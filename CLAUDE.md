# DLoop V2 (Specgraph research)

this repo contains research into trying to imporve on the DLoop Declarative Agentic development framework as descroibed in @previous/dloop-v1.md, @previous/spec-rules/, and @previous/tamm-agents.md, which are takenm from the repo https://github.com/omnifiedLtd/selfimloop.

The aim of the repo is to research and discuss a more formal and improved framework where we make a more complete 'spec graph'. here we want to develop the a full theory of a formal framweork for auto,mated agentic development backed by a spec graph tha completely describes the intended system. 

there is some rought initial intent for the rework in @initial-intent.md. 

The aim of the repo is to clarify the top level goals of the project, write them down formally and then discuss and research the ideal solution for the framework. We want to end up with frmal markdown documents and json schemas that descrie the specgraph framework, so that they can be consumed by an  agentic automated devlopment platform to guide completely automated software developemnmt.
