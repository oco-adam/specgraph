# Project Aim: Specgraph Research

## Purpose
This repository defines **DLoop V2 / Specgraph** as a formal framework for deterministic, agent-driven software manifestation.

## Position Relative to DLoop V1
DLoop V1 is treated as **reference material only** (inspiration and comparative input), not as a compatibility target.

Accordingly:
- Backward compatibility with DLoop V1 is **not** a project requirement.
- The framework may diverge wherever divergence improves formal clarity, completeness, or manifestation reliability.

## Core Aim
Design a **complete, minimal, machine-consumable spec graph** that describes an intended system sufficiently for automated agents to manifest that system predictably.

## Scope of the Intended Framework
The framework is expected to:

1. Encode behavioural requirements and non-behavioural implementation guidance when required for deterministic manifestation.
2. Use an explicit graph structure rather than a flat specification format.
3. Enable repeatable manifestation with identical or logically equivalent outcomes.
4. Remain minimal while still complete for its manifestation purpose.

## Near-Term Objective
Clarify and formalize top-level goals first, then produce rigorous markdown specifications and JSON schemas that define the Specgraph formalism.

## Intended End State
A robust formal specification foundation for fully automated agentic software development, where intended-system semantics are explicit enough to support predictable re-manifestation.
